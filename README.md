# Avis-hyprland-config
My arch linux hyprland config on framework 13 with Intel i5-1135G7. Credits to SolDoesTech for inspo and original files.
Edit: Switched to Ryzen 7 7840u mainboard and it still works (not that it's surprising, just wanted to note)
I would not recommend using this for your own use as it is customized to my work and has a lot of dependencies. I will not stop you though:)
